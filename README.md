# Hi there, I'm Kushagra! 👋

I'm a 13-year-old programming enthusiast passionate about all things tech!

- 🐍 Mainly diving into Python due to its simplicity and high potential.
- 🚀 Improving my C++ skills alongside my Python journey.
- 💡 Experimenting with Competitive Programming after a brief attempt at game development.
- 🎮 Currently developing a unique incremental game, a fusion of an incremental game and an Esoteric Programming Language.
- 🤖 Exploring Arduino by crafting my own somewhat rudimentary controller and a simple Unity game to go along with it.

Feel free to reach out—I'm always eager to chat about programming, tech exploration, or anything tech-related!
